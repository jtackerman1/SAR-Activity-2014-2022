Introduction: Domain problem characterization.
What is the problem you want to solve?
Explore the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) volume of data over the nine year period (2014 - 2022) and produce effective visualizations of the data using Tableau that will provide meaningful insight of the industry as a whole.

Data/operation abstraction design:
How did you prepare your data?
o	I had to combine source data that was broken out by industry to combine similar sheets with shared columns. 
o	I had to make several pivots to make the data usable and readable.
o	I had to provide applicable shared column fields to be able to join the tables correctly.

Future work:
What if any future work do you plan to keep on doing to improve your app.?
I would like to get more recent data and follow the trends.
